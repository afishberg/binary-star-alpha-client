# Binary Star: _Alpha_ - Client

This directory will soon contain the client for the in progress alpha version
of a game/DSL called Binary Star. The client will be written in Java with
Processing.

Although it doesn't do anything too interesting yet, you can run the code with the command `./gradlew run` in the top directory.

The game server can be found in [this](https://github.com/afishberg/binary-star-alpha-server) repository.
